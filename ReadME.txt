This is an example of classification problem where we train a model to find a transaction is fradulent or not

The data set contains 31 columns and 284807 rows. As this is a huge data set we use only a subset of this to 
and train and test the model.

In this problem we use IsolationForest and LocalOutlier algorithms...
